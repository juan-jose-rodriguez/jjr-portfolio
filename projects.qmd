## MSCA Postdoctoral — **S.T.A.R.S.** (Wuppertal)
A Schelling-inspired response to the “Science Wars”: reconstructing a realist framework that resists dissolving **Being** into **being-for-knowledge**. The project engages Schelling’s middle/late work and its dialogue with natural science.

- **Focus:** realist beginning of world & thinking; priority of *ratio essendi* over *ratio cognoscendi*; limits of absolute idealism.
- **Planned outputs:** 2 peer-reviewed articles + a short monograph on Schelling’s stance on idealism.
- **Open science & outreach:** OA deposits; public talks; highlights on YouTube.

- **Focus:** freedom, personhood, and social unity vs. coercive order; implications for modern state theory.
- **Plan:** teaching & workshops; conferences; public-facing dissemination.
- **Open science:** OA publications and repository deposits.

## Selected Past

### GAUK Project (Charles University), 2023–2024
**The problematic relationship between freedom and system in Schelling and Hegel (1804–1820) and its significance for the emergence of phenomenology in France and Germany**  
With Prof. Karel Novotný. The project examines how tensions between **freedom** and **system** in Schelling and Hegel informed early phenomenology in France and Germany, tracing concept shifts from *System der Freiheit* debates to later methodological transformations.
